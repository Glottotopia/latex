\BackTitle{Danish in Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar}
\BackBody{This book describes a fragment of the Danish language that is formalized in the framework of
Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar. Each chapter consist of a large empirical part that uses
corpus data for the discussion of phenomena whenever this is appropriate. The description is
theory-driven but the formulations of the insights are as theory-neutral as possible.

After a brief introduction into the basic assumptions that are made in HPSG, we provide a
topological model of the Danish clause. This topological model is used to explain the basic clause
structure of Danish (SVO) and to set up the HPSG analysis of these rather basic facts. After this
rather basic part detailed descriptions and analyses of the following phenomena are provided: object
and negation shift, copula constructions, including specificational structures and the relation to
left dilocation and question tag formation, extraposition, passive, raising passives, in which
objects of embedded verbs are raised to subject, preposed negation, extraction (V2), the insertion
of positional expletives in extraction contexts, and \emph{Do}-Support.

The grammar that is described in this book is computerprocessable and hence internally
consistent. It was developed in the CoreGram project, which develops grammars of various languages
and tries to find crosslinguistic generalizations. This is also reflected in the book, which
contains sections that compare the analyses for Danish with those for German and English.

Hey, this is another text that is written by me, not be \LaTeX{}. It is much nicer, although the,
English may be broken and the interpuction incorrect.\footnote{%
  The point of writing this text is that I can insert this footnote here so that Ulrike can see how
  a footnote looks like. The lipsum package does not insert footnotes.

  This is a new paragraph in the footnote.
}\footnote{%
  And if they did not die, the wrote another footnote.

  This is another new paragraph, but it is longer. It may stretch to the next line if I add some
  more words.
