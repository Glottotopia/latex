\chapter{Guidelines for Authors}

The following sections describe the layout of various items that play a role in typesetting. 

\section{Figures}

\section{Tables}

\section{References}


We use the \emph{Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics}, which is described here:
\url{http://celxj.org/downloads/UnifiedStyleSheet.pdf}. The \bibtex file is contained in the \latex
classes that are used for typesetting \lsp books. Please deliver a \bibtex file with all your
references together with your submissions. \bibtex can be exported from all common bibliography
tools.

The references in your \bibtex file will be typeset correctly automatically. So, provided the
\bibtex file is correct, authors do not have to worry about this. But there are some things to
observe in the main text. Please cite as shown in Table~\ref{tab-citation}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Author & As \citet[215]{Saussure16a} has shown\\
Work   & As was shown in \citew[215]{Saussure16a}, this is a problem for \ldots\\
\end{tabular}
